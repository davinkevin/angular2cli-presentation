# Presnetation about AngularCLI

## Making your life EA-SI-ER !!!


## Hard to start

* JS Fatigue

* 3 years ago : GruntJs
* 2 years ago : GulpJS
* 1 year ago : Webpack & JSPM

I just want to code !?!

Thanks the Ember team :D


## What it can do for me ?

* Create a global folder structure to help you start project
* Generate assets and elements at the right place (CSS(or SASS, SCSS, LESS) | HTML | TS | SPEC)
*
* Write skeleton of my test


## What's next ?

* Upgrading against the style-guide
* Support for Javascript, Dart and/or maybe more ?
* Create its own `Template`
